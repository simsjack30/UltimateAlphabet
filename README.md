# Ultimate Alphabet Game

This is a game based on Mike Wilks' book *The Ultimate Alphabet*. Currently only available in print, I wanted to bring this book to life on the web. This digital version allows for stat tracking between plays among all players, something that wouldnâ€™t be possible in the print version.

The project is built with Svelte, SvelteKit, PocketBase, Skeleton UI, hosted on Railway, and deployed on Vercel.

### How to Build It Yourself

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   `git clone https://github.com/simsjack30/UltimateAlphabet.git`

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Navigate into the project directory and run:  
   `npm install`

3. **Set Up PocketBase**  
   Follow the [PocketBase documentation](https://pocketbase.io/docs/) to set up your PocketBase instance. My PocketBase is hosted on Railway, but PocketHost is a powerful alternative. Update the project with your PocketBase API details.

4. **Run the Development Server**  
   Start the development server with:  
   `npm run dev`
